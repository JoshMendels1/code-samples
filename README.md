# evil-hangman
I created this project for an assignment in my data structures class (CSCI262) on October 16, 2020. The point of the project was to make a hangman game that is impossible to win. The program doesn't vhoose a word from the beginning, but keeps track of a large list of possible words left given the guessed letters. The program will always choose the path that has the most possible words to choose from, so the correct word will likely be guessed with very few letters left to guess from in the alphabet. For extra credit in the class, I also added a visualization of how many letters have been guessed with a simple version and a complex version of hangman ascii art.
